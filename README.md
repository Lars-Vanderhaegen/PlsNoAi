# PlsNoAi
Simple Chrome Extension to remove the AI summary from Google Search results. 

## Installation
1. Navigate to your Chrome Extensions
2. Enable developer mode
3. Click 'load unpacked' and select the PlsNoAi file
4. Done! Enjoy searching without the AI summary!

## How it works
The extension looks for the 'blur' event, which upon being triggered will automatically add the -ai suffix to your search query.
-ai is known to remove the AI summary from appearing on the Google Search results. Because it's quite annoying to type '-ai' after every search query, I made this extension to automate it for you!
